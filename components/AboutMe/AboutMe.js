    <SectionText>
      I am a 3-rd year Electrical Engineering Student at University of Calgary,
      and I am passionate about hands-on learning in science labs, as well as
      software projects in web development. I love working in a team setting,
      which is why I have been working on a lot of interesting projects with
      other students throughout my degree! I am also a huge K-pop enthusiast, so
      definitely reach out to me if you would like good BTS song suggestions ðŸ˜Ž
